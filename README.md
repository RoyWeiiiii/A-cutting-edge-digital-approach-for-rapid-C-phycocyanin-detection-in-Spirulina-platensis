# _Spirulina platensis_ biomass & extracted CPC image dataset
The google drive [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dXDUHCD9nTJaF0CFyxqUkHKZH8Ko1XjF?usp=drive_link] contains the cropped image dataset of _Spirulina platensis_ biomass & extracted CPC grown under BG-11 medium in the period of 12 days. Subsequently, each day will contain a subfolder of both image capturing devices such as smartphone [Model => Iphone_13_Pro_Max] and digital camera [Model => Nikon_Z50]. Each image capturing device will contain a subfolder of covered [images taken without any light disturbances] and light_disturbed [images taken under light disturbed condition]. The experiment is conducted for 3 batches. The image dataset is publicly available for academic and research purposes.
