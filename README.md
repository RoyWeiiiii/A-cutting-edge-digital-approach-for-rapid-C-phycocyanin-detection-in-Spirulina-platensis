# Revolutionising biotechnology: A cutting-edge digital approach for rapid C-phycocyanin detection in Spirulina platensis

In our study, we evaluate the performance of three artificial intelligence (AI) models—Support Vector Machines (SVM), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)—in predicting the CPC (C-phycocyanin) concentrations from Spirulina platensis (S.platensis) biomass and extracted CPC images. We investigate the variation of input parameters under different image-capturing devices, and lighting conditions to simulate based on real-world scenarios. Results signify that SVM model exhibits R2 values of (0.9304 - 0.9867) and (0.9967 - 0.9981) when using S.platensis biomass and extracted CPC images, respectively. XGBoost model demonstrates higher R2 values of (0.9899 - 0.9968) and (0.9996 - 0.9999) for S.platensis biomass and extracted CPC images, respectively. CNN model managed to achieve R2 values of (0.9769 - 0.9986) and (0.9969 - 0.9991) for S.platensis biomass and extracted CPC images, respectively. To shed light on this, our work suggests the feasibility and efficiency of AI-driven methods for CPC concentration prediction.
